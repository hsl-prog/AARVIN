AARVIN is a personal project I began concepting in the summer of 2021. My primary goal with AARVIN is to learn. I am 
excited by the embedded programming of autonomous vehicles, medical technology, and so many other gadgets. So, what 
better way to learn than to dive right in?

Originally, I intended for AARVIN to be a waterborn vehicle, but due to the limitations of my experience with robotics and 
the hour-long drive to the nearest lake, I decided to change directions. I spent the better part of a year becoming more 
familiar with the concepts behind autonomous robotics, navigation theory, and the techonolgy of Arduino and Raspberry Pi 
before ever beginning the mechanical or software development of AARVIN. 

Finally, I had come up with an achievable goal. While the concept of an autonomous research boat was inspiring, it was 
difficult to determine what I was setting out to achieve with it. What would be AARVIN's purpose? To collect general 
weather data? To search for trash? To locate sunken vessels? All of these concepts are achievable on a grand scale, but 
within the confines of a college student's time and budget, the pursuit of these goals became much more difficult. So, 
what would be more attainable? 

My father, a software engineer at Lockheed Martin, half-jokingly threw out the idea of building a little car that drove 
around and took pictures, much like the Google Street Car, and from there I was hooked. This was an achievable goal, with
a reasonable purpose that helped define all of the design, style, and development questions that I was getting stuck on. 
From there, I was able to quickly sit down and determine exactly what I wanted and needed out of my hardware. 

I decided te use a tank treaded vehicle due to its robust ability to traverse unstable outdoor terrain, and its availability 
as a robotics kit on Amazon. I had specs that I required, but since I did not have access to a laser cutter or a 3D printer, 
my options for chasses were limited. If I'd had more time and access to 3d printers and laser cutters, I certainly would have 
gone the route of designing AARVIN from scratch, but I was able to find a suitable kit on Amazon including a Raspberry Pi:

In addition to the Raspberry Pi, I have an Arduino Mega and several other components like ultrasonic sensors, gps modules, 
etc. So far, the hardest part of working on AARVIN was deciding what AARVIN was going to be. 

The assembly of AARVIN will commence upon arrival of the kit in early July.

I've made some wonderful advancements with AARVIN! I was able to get the project approved for credit with my university, so 
the bulk of development will be undertaken during this Fall semester of CS469 - Project Management in Computer Science with 
Professor Eric Vogel. 

For materials I have obtained the Sphero RVR, the Advanced Autonomous Kit for Sphero RVR by Sparkfun, an Arduino Due, a 
cheap children's camera, some opto-isolators, and various jumper wires. I'm currently looking into obtaining a better GPS
module, since the one I have at the moment is only accurate to about a 10 foot radius, which is not ideal for the type of 
task I'm aiming to accomplish with my navigation. I'm hoping to have the robot, when complete, take a tour around the road I
live on, since it is a loop in a neighborhood, and take pictures at each house on the loop. Houses are approximately 50 feet 
apart, so a 20 foot diameter of accuracy is good enough, but I'd preferably like to get that to a 6 foot diameter, especially 
if indoor use is desired as well. Currently that's not part of my goal, but it would be a bonus to be able to map out a floor 
of a house, similar to the 3d tours on Zillow. 

Of course, AARVIN is just collecting the photos, but I have thought about continuing the project by creating a software that
would piece together the photos into that 3D map. But probably not. That would be nice for the project, but it is not 
something that I would be interested in learning to do, since I'm more interested in math, physics and lower level programming.

With the start of the semester I am setting up my project plans. Professor Vogel has us using progressive decomposition to create
our task list and then we're using breadth-first continuous integration for implementation. To help with my planning and 
organization, I am making use of Jira and using agile sprints to more helpfully manage my tasks. My goal is to have the hardware 
fully assembled by the end of next week, but debugging and improvements will continue throughout the semester. 

All said and done, AARVIN will be functional by the end of the semester, which is early December. Likely, given the complexity 
of the project, I will continue development beyond the semester. But, it is will be a major accomplishment to have AARVIN working
before I graduate, and I am so excited to learn so much.
